MedaSync Challenge
Created by Colby Stefanik

This program is my answer to the challenge given by MedaSync.

The project is entirely written in JavaScript, and was designed to remain relatively simple with great potential for further features. For example, though the challenge did not require that someone be able to view specifically what treatments a patient received or at what times, it would be relatively simple to add that functionality. This is perhaps my design philosophy in a nutshell; leave as much open for future development as possible so adding features is quicker and relatively challenge free.

I hope this provides a good insight into my coding ability and design.
